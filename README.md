# 🌱PopW - Organic Particle Life Simulator 

## Overview
This project is a life simulator for organic particles, heavily inspired by and partially based on David R. Miller's **BioSim4** ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4)). I greatly appreciate his work and have used it as a foundation to explore and expand upon similar ideas in artificial life simulations.
Many other ideas are taken here and there from the internet, and in particular from another great inspiring project  called **The Bibites**  ([https://www.youtube.com/@TheBibitesDigitalLife](https://www.youtube.com/@TheBibitesDigitalLife)).

In this simulator, simple agents evolve in a  2D grid environment, responding to stimuli and adapting their behavior through simulated evolutionary processes. The goal is to observe how simple rules can give rise to complex behaviors over successive generations.

## Features
- Simulated organic particles that interact, move, and evolve. We call it "Pop".

- A very simple neural network that models the Pop brain 
- Genetic algorithm-based evolution to optimize pop behavior.
- 2D  grid world. Height of the hills and temperature field are visibile on the map. Other parameters can be tuned

- TODO -- multi-threaded execution for performance.
- TODO -- Visualization tools to observe agent behavior.

## Dependencies
To compile and run this project, you will need:
- A C++17-compliant compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- OpenCV (for visualization)
- Eigen3 (for matrix operations )
- python matplotlib module
- python networkx module
- python scipy

## Installation & Usage
Clone the repository and build the project using CMake:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/framorgi/popw
cd popw
mkdir bin && cd bin
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j$(nproc) 
```

Run the simulation with:
```sh
./popw
```

Simulation parameters can be modified in the `param.ini` file.
